    <h1>WHAT IS OVERPOPULATION</h1>
    <P>Overpopulation refers to a population which exceeds its 
    sustainable size within a particular environment or habitat.
    Overpopulation results from an increased birth rate, decreased death rate,
     the immigration to a new ecological niche with fewer predators, or the sudden decline in available resources.</P>
